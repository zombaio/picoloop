<h1>PICOLOOP 0.77 README</h1>

<p>Manual and tutorial for PC/PSP/PSVita/Pocketchip can be fetch here : https://github.com/farvardin/picoloop-manual</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Picoloop is a synth and a stepsequencer (a clone of the famous nanoloop).
The step sequencer play 4 tracks simultaneously, by default each track are 16 steps long, you can set the track to be up to 128 steps.
Each track has a synthengine which can be a Virtual Analog, a Drum Synth, a FM synth.
Each of the step can be edited on the 4 tracks.
So for example, you can set a C4 note on step 0, nothing on step 1 and 2, then a D+5 on step 3 until the step 15.</p>

<p>A pattern of 16 steps is played repeatedly while these notes can be edited in various respects like volume, pitch, filter, lfo etc. 
All parameters are set step-wise, so you can make huge variation of sound on the same pattern.
Each channel's patterns can be saved to file slots and are then available for new combinations. 
Finally, saved patterns can be arranged in a song structure.</p>

<p>Besides the song editor and manual loading of patterns, there are 3 different ways to modify each channel's patterns so that they form longer structures:                                       </p>

<ul>
<li>1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 speed                                                               </li>
<li>Different pattern lengths by track</li>
</ul>

<p>Picoloop is targeted for linux/SDL compatible system.
It uses SDL     to render graphics.
It uses RtAudio or SDL to render audio out.
It uses RtMidi  to send and receive midi message, today only clock</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>There is two pane :
 - the 16 steps ;
 - the menu which is above the 16 steps ;</p>

<p>On the 16 boxes, there is a moving cursor which displays the current played step.
And another cursor which displays the current selected step.
There is a text menu, which allows you to select channel and edit parameter.
All notes in the sequencer can be edited simultaneously.</p>

<h3>The menu mode</h3>

<p>The menu mode changes the selected textual menu at the bottom of the screen.
This allows you to choose what kind of parameter you want to change, for example, the NOTE, the OSC, the Filter...
In menu mode, when you press left/right, it changes the textual menu in the bottom of the screen</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/&gt;             move backward/forward in the menu
^/v             select the track from 0 to track 3
B               do nothing
A + &lt;/&gt;/^/v,    edit all steps at once
A               enter the edit mode
L               go to the next     16 steps on the same track
R               go to the previous 16 steps on the same track
SELECT          call menu2 or menu1 ( it cycle between the two menu )
</code></pre>

<h3>The edit mode</h3>

<p>The edit mode changes the current step on the 16 steps display.
In edit mode, when you press left/right, it changes the current step in the sequencer.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/&gt;             select next step
^/v             select step+4, step-4
B               enter a note in a step, it works as a cut/paste
A + &lt;/&gt;/^/v,    edit the current step
A               do nothing
L               go to the next     16 step on the same track
R               go to the previous 16 step on the same track
SELECT          call menu2 or menu1 ( it cycle between the two menu )
START           cycle between the different parameter
</code></pre>

<h4>menu1</h4>

<p>The menu 1 is the first menu. It allows to modify the parameter of the synthengine of the current track.
Each synth engine has different kind of parameter.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ol>
<li>A/R  : the enveloppe of the synth</li>
<li>Note : the value of the note trigged</li>
<li>OSC  : the oscillator of the synth</li>
<li>VCO  : the vco parameter for example a osc1 and osc2 mixer</li>
<li>LFO  : the lfo parameter</li>
<li>FLTR : the filter parameter.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the global overview of the most common parameters you will find by synth engine.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A/R : </p>

<h4>menu 2</h4>

<p>The menu 2 is a more general menu. You can:</p>

<ol>
<li>L/S   load and save a pattern  track or the 4 pattern track ;</li>
<li>BANK  change the current bank which allow you to have more pattern.</li>
<li>PSH   shift left or right the pattern of a track and add bunch of 16 step ;</li>
<li>MAC   change the current synth engine, synth, drumsynth, dbopl (adlib fm)</li>
<li>FX    apply fx on the current track delay</li>
<li>BPM   change the BPM and swing of the 4 track and the step diviser of the current track</li>
</ol>

<h5>L/S menu</h5>

<p>The top menu shows the tracks and patterns. 
- Save your current track by selecting an empty slow, then B+down.
- Save your current pattern (group of 4 tracks) by selecting a column, then A+down.
- Load a track with A+up (it will replace your current working track).
- Load a pattern with B+up (il will replace the 4 current working tracks).</p>

<p>You can clone a track by loading it into memory, then saving it to another track.</p>

<p>The menu below (song position) allows you to order your tracks. You can enter it with Start key. 
- Define Loop start position with A+up
- Define Loop end position with A+down
- Change the values with B+up and B+down.</p>

<h5>PSH menu</h5>

<ul>
<li>Increase the track size (16 steps block) with A+UP</li>
<li>Decrease the track size (16 steps block) with A+DOWN</li>
<li>Increase the track size (1 step) with A+RIGHT</li>
<li>Decrease the track size (1 step) with A+LEFT</li>
<li>Navigate into the new steps (move the position by -16 or +16) with the LEFT and RIGHT SHOULDER (or TAB and BACKSPACE on PC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>Every pattern is stored in the bank/bankXXX/file so if you backup this directory you should be fine.</p>

<p>You can write pattern on OpenDingux and push it on your laptop, unfortunately, it could sound little different.
The OpenDingux a320 lack FPU so every thing is done in fixed point.
On PC and PSP it's done in floating point...</p>

<p>You won't be able to push pattern from PC to PSP/Opendingux, it could work but it depend if the Machine is available on the PSP.
Today ( picoloop 0.75c ) only Picosynth, Picodrum, DBopl and PBSynth are available on slower platform : PSP, opendingux.</p>

<p>The combo Select+UP, Select+Down allow you to raise or decrease the internal volume of the apps</p>

<p>If you plug on Windows/Linux a midi cable you can use it with midi sync in or midi sync out.
The MMC message ( "play", "stop" ) are received by picoloop, but it doesn't transmit this kind of message.
It understand the "stop" and "play" MMC message. </p>

<p>You can use midi delay to fine tune the sync between midi hardware and picoloop software.</p>

<p>The MDA Drum synth works with file patch ".ds" file.
So if you have a laptop with a harddrive which is not an ssd, you should work with a PSU and not the battery to
avoid disk spinning down. The automatic disk shutdown will block audio for 10ms and it became really audible.
Will be fixed in a latter version.</p>

<h3>Package dependency, build from source</h3>

<p>This section describes the dependency for building picoloop.
On most platform in 2016, you will need this kind of package.</p>

<pre><code> - libsdl*      =&gt; version 1.2 with the "ttf" and "gfx"
 - libasound2*  =&gt; alsa
 - libpthread*  =&gt; pthread for multiple thread
 - g++          =&gt; I use the g++ 4.7.2  
 - make         =&gt; I use the make 3.81
 - libjack-dev  =&gt; I use jack 2.0, and the jack dependency is needed today
</code></pre>

<h4>LASTEST SOURCE</h4>

<p>You can always update to the lastest source.
But, you should then switch to a tag.</p>

<p><tt> # git clone https://github.com/yoyz/audio.git </tt> </br>
<tt> # git tag </tt> </br>
<tt> # git checkout picoloop-0.75b </tt> </br></p>

<p>Tag are safier.
And today, there is a known issue, the build of PatternPlayer need two build.
The issue come from the "mkdir" which is launch after the other command, so every thing seem to fail on the first make...
Unfortunately I have not fixed this issue because you fall into this issue only when cloning the software from the repo.</p>

<h4>COMPILATION FOR DEBIAN</h4>

<pre><code> # cd      picoloop
 # make -f Makefile.RtAudio_debian               clean
 # make -f Makefile.RtMidi_debian                clean
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_debian_RtAudio clean
 # make -f Makefile.RtAudio_debian
 # make -f Makefile.RtMidi_debian
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_debian_RtAudio
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_debian_RtAudio
</code></pre>

<h4>COMPILATION FOR POCKETCHIP</h4>

<p>You have to build it on the pocketchip.</p>

<pre><code> # cd      picoloop
 # make -f Makefile.RtAudio_pocketchip               clean
 # make -f Makefile.RtMidi_pocketchip                clean
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_pocketchip_RtAudio clean
 # make -f Makefile.RtAudio_pocketchip
 # make -f Makefile.RtMidi_pocketchip
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_pocketchip_RtAudio
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_pocketchip_RtAudio
</code></pre>

<h4>COMPILATION FOR RASPBERRYPI1</h4>

<p>You have to build it directly on the raspberry.
If you have a raspberry 2 or 3, you should go to the "debian" section.
This build type is a light version like the opendingux one.</p>

<pre><code> # cd      picoloop
 # make -f Makefile.RtAudio_raspi1                  clean
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_raspi1_RtAudio    clean
 # make -f Makefile.RtAudio_raspi1                  
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_raspi1_RtAudio    
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_raspi1_RtAudio
</code></pre>

<h4>COMPILATION FOR OPENDINGUX</h4>

<p>On debian you need the /opt/opendingux-toolchain/ directory.
you can fetch fetch it there : http://www.treewalker.org/opendingux/</p>

<pre><code> # cd      picoloop
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.RtAudio_opendingux               clean
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_opendingux_RtAudio clean

 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.RtAudio_opendingux
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_opendingux_RtAudio
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_opendingux_RtAudio
</code></pre>

<h4>COMPILATION FOR GP2X</h4>

<p>On debian you need the /opt/open2x/ directory.
you can fetch it there : http://wiki.gp2x.org/articles/i/n/s/Installing<em>the</em>Open2x_toolchain.html
I don't have build it month ago, so at your own risk.</p>

<pre><code> # cd      picoloop
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.RtAudio_opendingux               clean
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_opendingux_RtAudio clean

 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.RtAudio_opendingux
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_opendingux_RtAudio
 # make -j 64 -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_opendingux_RtAudio
</code></pre>

<h4>COMPILATION FOR WINDOWS WITH MINGW32</h4>

<p>On debian, you need the mingw32 package.
Picoloop provide the header and binary for SDL 1.2 on windows.
So here it is a "cross build" you build on linux for windows.</p>

<pre><code> # cd         picoloop
 # make       -f Makefile.RtAudio_windows                              clean
 # make       -f Makefile.RtMidi_windows                               clean
 # make       -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_windows_mingw_RtAudio          clean
 # make       -f Makefile.RtAudio_windows                              
 # make       -f Makefile.RtMidi_windows                               
 # make       -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_windows_mingw_RtAudio 
 # make       -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_windows_mingw_RtAudio
</code></pre>

<h4>COMPILATION FOR PSP</h4>

<p>you need to have the sdk, the toolchain and the external lib.
All can be fetched here : https://github.com/pspdev</p>

<pre><code> # cd      picoloop
 # source ~/local/pspdev/env_build
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_psp_SDL        clean
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_psp_SDL 
 # make -f Makefile.PatternPlayer_psp_SDL
</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<h1>USAGE</h1>

<p>file named dataP&lt;%d>T&lt;%d>.pic store information about saved pattern.
This file will be created when you store file in the "L/S" menu.</p>

<h1>DEBUG</h1>

<p>You need two file font.bmp and font.ttf which are located next to the source.</p>

<h1>DEBUG PSP</h1>

<p>You need your psp gcc compiler, the library and psplinkusb.</p>

<p>1) Launch psplink on the psp this is an EBOOT.PBP.
2) as root, launch usbhostfs<em>pc ( you need to be root to access the psp by usb and you need to be in the somewhere/psplinkusb/usbhostfs</em>pc/ folder ).
You should see it is connected.</p>

<p>3) In another terminal launch pspsh.  Try to 'ls -l', to see if all is ok.
Copy the prx file in the usbhostfs_pc directory, you should see it with 'ls -l'</p>

<p>If you want to launch PatternPlayer.prx, launch it with pspsh : ./PatternPlayer.prx
In this case, you need the prx file ( not an elf or EBOOT.PBP ).</p>

<p>If you want to debug it with psp-gdb, you can do it by this command in two different window.</p>

<pre><code>     host0:/&gt; debug PatternPlayer.prx
</code></pre>

<p>In another window : </p>

<pre><code>     $ psp-gdb ./PatternPlayer.elf
 (gdb) target remote localhost:10001
     Remote debugging using localhost:10001
</code></pre>

<p>In this case you need a prx and an elf file.</p>

<h1>DEBUG PS VITA</h1>

<p>read https://tai.henkaku.xyz/ you need to go to this website, then use the vita exploit on your ps vita at this url http://henkaku.xyz/go/
Here your ps vita should have the "beta exploit".
You need to have psp2shell compiled from https://github.com/yoyz/psp2shell
it's a from from https://github.com/Cpasjuste/psp2shell but it should be at the right commit level.
Compiled psp2shell so you have a psp2shell binary
Compiled the kernel and user module and put it on your ps vita in ux0:/tai
Then build picoloop for your psvita with -DDEBUG_PRINTF, it should work</p>

<p>grab your core file in the ux0:/data directory, the last core</p>

<p>use vita parse core from here : https://github.com/xyzz/vita-parse-core
install it as root using the pip as root :</p>

<h1>pip install -r requirements.txt</h1>

<p>then 
$ zcat psp2core-1510435186-0x0000092601-eboot.bin.psp2dmp > psp
$ python /home/peyrardj/build/vita-parse-core/main.py psp picoloop_vita.elf</p>

<p>You can also push the eboot.bin binary directly in the good location with this command </p>

<p>psp2shell> put eboot.bin ux0:/app/PICOLOOP1/</p>
